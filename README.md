- The goal of this coding exercise is to create a React app that uses the Reddit API to display a given subreddit's posts.

- Provide a UI that allows a user to enter a subreddit (i.e. reactjs - https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs.json)

- When the UI receives the subreddit, display the most recent posts

- The UI should only show 10 posts at a time with the ability to move forward/backward through the list of posts

- In order to test your code, provide instructions in your README.md on how to compile, run, and test your code
